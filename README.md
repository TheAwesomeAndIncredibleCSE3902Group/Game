Hello! This is our game repo where we're making the video game 😎

AwesomeRPG is a Zelda clone that will eventually include turn-based RPG elements.

Interacting with an enemy sends the player to the turn-based realm, where they
    will have to defeat them with a collection of moves. After this the player
    can return to the overworld and continue their quest.
Items like potions will be picked up in the overworld but used in battle.
