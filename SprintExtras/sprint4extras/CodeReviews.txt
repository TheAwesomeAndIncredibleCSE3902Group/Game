Code under review: Whole SoundManager Folder
Review time: 3 minutes
The code at least at a glance seems fine, the SoundFactories are all very simple and contain a lot of variables for each sound file. 
I think some regions and comments would be useful to have for these, but not necessary. ThemeController similarily is pretty simple
a very small fix is that the if statements about timeSinceIntroStart for PlayCurrentAreaTheme should probably be if else instead of
two if statements that need to be chacked everytime.

Code under review: UI for readability
Review time: 5 minutes
I know you are in the works for a big code change, but I will still give feedback on what is currently here since it could be useful.
This code could definitely benefit from some more comments. For example I think a little summary description at the top of classes 
would be good, especially since a lot of the classes are just constructors and a draw method. ElementBase could use some comments
and regions especially due to its length. Besides that I think the naems of functions and variables are good.

Code under review: OverworldState for quality
Review time: 5 minutes
The OverworldState is well put together. The main change I would make would be moving the UI elements into their own class that the 
overworld state could manipulate. The UI is still under construction so abstracting it out would mean we have less to change 
when it is completed. It could also be converted to a singleton, but it works well as-is.

There are a lot of comments, both function descriptions and in function comments. All of the related functions are next to each other
and the comments are descriptive enough to know what is going on.

Code under review: BattleScene and general battle mechanics for readability
Review time: 5 minutes
When first reading over the BattleScene I had a little bit of trouble understanding
how it functioned, and it would be nice if there were some comments that explained
what each method did, the steps that each method should run in for properly running
a battle, etc. Right now we don't need AllyList but may be useful if we ever
implement multiple players.
Additionally, how each of the "battle" classses worked was a little bit confusing
at first, especially with the enemies and player deriving from the same class.
But it made sense after reading throgho it.
For each of the classes, the names of the properties and methods make sense for
what they are used for.

Code under review: StartScreenState for quality
Review time: 5 minutes
Using a method specifically for lerping the text color is a good approach; I believe
that when I did something similar for the SelectionAnimationElement I did it all inline.
Additionally, I believe that this approach of having dedicated ScreenState classes containing 
the RootElement is good because it allows different UIs to be drawn easily between each
state without worrying about removing/hiding elements from a single RootElement of Game1.
There may be a better approach to having multiple ChangeTo___State methods throughout 
each -ScreenState class because we could probably just handle it with an abstract class 
that StartScreenState and other -ScreenState classes would implement.

Code under review: BattleEnemies for quality
Review time: 15 minutes
Enemies are set up in a way that makes them clear and easy to add to. Enemies are relatively simple,
but if they had more functionality some changes could be made, like putting each action in its
own method. Also, these classes have an interface that inherents from another interface. My personal
preference is to have the class inherent from both interfaces in a flat organization, rather than a
hierarchy. But, either way works. BattleScene could be changed to have a method that returns a random
ally, rather than each individual enemy handling it.

Code under review: BattleEnemies for readability
Use of enums for actions aids readabiliy. Variables and methods have good names. I suggest long lines
(ie string concatination) get broken up. It also isn't immediately clear what the TurnList class does 
by its name. Documentation for that class would be welcome. CurrentSet is a List, not a Set.
