Code under review: Whole SoundManager Folder
Review time: 3 minutes
The code at least at a glance seems fine, the SoundFactories are all very simple and contain a lot of variables for each sound file. 
I think some regions and comments would be useful to have for these, but not necessary. ThemeController similarily is pretty simple
a very small fix is that the if statements about timeSinceIntroStart for PlayCurrentAreaTheme should probably be if else instead of
two if statements that need to be chacked everytime.

Code under review: UI for readability
Review time: 5 minutes
I know you are in the works for a big code change, but I will still give feedback on what is currently here since it could be useful.
This code could definitely benefit from some more comments. For example I think a little summary description at the top of classes 
would be good, especially since a lot of the classes are just constructors and a draw method. ElementBase could use some comments
and regions especially due to its length. Besides that I think the naems of functions and variables are good.

Code under review: OverworldState for quality
Review time: 5 minutes
The OverworldState is well put together. The main change I would make would be moving the UI elements into their own class that the 
overworld state could manipulate. The UI is still under construction so abstracting it out would mean we have less to change 
when it is completed. It could also be converted to a singleton, but it works well as-is.

There are a lot of comments, both function descriptions and in function comments. All of the related functions are next to each other
and the comments are descriptive enough to know what is going on.
