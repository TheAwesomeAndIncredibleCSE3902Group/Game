Code under review: All of the Collision code for readability
Review took about ~15 minutes (forgot to check time so might be completely off)

There's a lot going on for all the collision, but the comments for the methods do a decent job at concisely explaining the code's function.
The names for the Collision classes (the commands are fine) are a bit basic and aren't thatt descriptive. I'm not sure if they necessarily 
need to be much more descriptive, but when I was first reading through the code I got a little mixed up with the naming of the classes, it 
definitely doesn't help that they all start with Collision. I think all of the commands are immediately understandable, which is kind of in 
part of being a command.

Code under review: Pickup and Potion for code quality
Review took about 5 minutes

Ignoring the parts that are commented as in progress or unfinished, the code quality seems good. I like that the usage of abstract classes 
allows for the creation of seperate "Pickups" based on the structure of the Pickup class. The classes are fairly simple, though there will 
definitely be functional differences in the future as we have the pickups probably mostly be inventory items. Not an issue or something that 
would take effort to change, but I think that it'd probably be good to make it so the size of the pickup isn't necessarily set or at least 
have a constructor where the size could be changed. Since our game isn't grid based (the only grid based usage is for tile mapping), we don't
need to have pickups be a set size. Anyways, code seems fine for what's currently there and I like how it's set up for more in the future.

Code Under Review: Map Parser for Readability
Review time: 3.5 minutes

The function is a behemoth. The comments do a good job of describing each process which is occuring in
the function, but the functions length can make it easy to lose track of what's happening at any point.
The RoomMapToXML function should be broken up into multiple helper functions to improve the cohesion at any
given point during the process. Ideally each function should be around 10-15 lines of code at max to ensure that
at no step during the process is a single function handling too much. It's fine to create more function overhead
if it gives each function a clear single target purpose.

Code Under Review: IEnemyBattle along with its heirs
Review time: 5 minutes

The IEnemyBattle Interface is well made in allowing for the battleScene to simply iterate over all the different
enemies and do what they need to do. Along with allowing each specific enemy class to have a short implementation
allowing for it to have high cohesion. Only problem I would argue, is that the IEnemyBattle interface should have more
generic data such as things like the CurrentHealth property being moved into there along with things such as fainted
status and speed; This would allow for enemies to be treated more uniformly, along with further narrowing down the
concrete classes into just showing the differences between the enemies.

Code Under Review: CollisionObject for Readability
Review time: 5 minutes
DetectCollision has proper comments which describes the method and CollisionObject parameter. The fields are named well, 
but collider could be given a more descriptive name. CollisionDirection is private and so doesn't need documentation
comments, but the logic in the method is a little obscured, and including a ternary in the same line as comparison
operators makes it more obscure.

Code Under Review: ChangeCurrentRoomCommand for code quality
Review time: 5 minutes

The command functions correctly to switch the current room based on cardinals. It is fairly low coupling, although 
it does require a refrence to myGame.RoomMap. The only change I would make for quality would be to move the logic 
from the command into the RoomAtlas class. That would make it more closely follow the command pattern, as an 
individual command shouldn't contain any logic.
