Code under review: All of the Collision code for readability
Review took about ~15 minutes (forgot to check time so might be completely off)

There's a lot going on for all the collision, but the comments for the methods do a decent job at concisely explaining the code's function.
The names for the Collision classes (the commands are fine) are a bit basic and aren't thatt descriptive. I'm not sure if they necessarily 
need to be much more descriptive, but when I was first reading through the code I got a little mixed up with the naming of the classes, it 
definitely doesn't help that they all start with Collision. I think all of the commands are immediately understandable, which is kind of in 
part of being a command.

Code under review: Pickup and Potion for code quality
Review took about 5 minutes

Ignoring the parts that are commented as in progress or unfinished, the code quality seems good. I like that the usage of abstract classes 
allows for the creation of seperate "Pickups" based on the structure of the Pickup class. The classes are fairly simple, though there will 
definitely be functional differences in the future as we have the pickups probably mostly be inventory items. Not an issue or something that 
would take effort to change, but I think that it'd probably be good to make it so the size of the pickup isn't necessarily set or at least 
have a constructor where the size could be changed. Since our game isn't grid based (the only grid based usage is for tile mapping), we don't
need to have pickups be a set size. Anyways, code seems fine for what's currently there and I like how it's set up for more in the future.
