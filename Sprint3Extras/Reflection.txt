There was some confusion between Jesse and I on the division of labor over the RPG Battle Mechanics.
I believe the issue there was that Jesse and I needed to communicate more directly on the matter during development, 
which is something I hopefully will improve on to make sure I provide more work for the next sprint.
Otherwise, I think our team still performed pretty well and the team stayed pretty committed to working on the project.
