There was some confusion between Jesse and I on the division of labor over the RPG Battle Mechanics.
I believe the issue there was that Jesse and I needed to communicate more directly on the matter during development, 
which is something I hopefully will improve on to make sure I provide more work for the next sprint.
Otherwise, I think our team still performed pretty well and the team stayed pretty committed to working on the project.

Sprint work needs to be more clearly defined so that everyone knows exactly what they need to do and how much
of it needs to be done, by the end of the sprint. Additionally we need to stick harder to sprint deadlines treating
them more as hard goals rather than soft ones lest we fall behind.


Iris
---------
We got a lot done this sprint but a lot of it was completed towards the end of the sprint, rather than the work being more
spread out. We still have a lot to do to turn our game into the RPG we plan, both on the coding and design sides of things,
but I'm still confident our team can get it done.


Eli
---------
I mostly worked on building out the UI framework throughout this sprint in preparation for the RPG battle UI, pause menu, title screen, etc.
So, I was not involved very much with the main group. Additionally, I feel that I did not manage time well and should have communicated
a bit more with John and Jesse who worked on the logic for the RPG battle mechanics, so they could get a clearer understanding
of how we will be tying the state with the UI in the future.

Work progressed well this sprint and large systems were built cleanly and with surprisingly few hiccups. I would like to see
the team (including myself) adhere more closely to the functionality deadlines. The majority of the commits came in over the
last week, which was understandable in some cases (ie building out complicated systems), but I would like to see incremental
progress earlier so issues could be caught sooner. Nonetheless, I don't question that we'll keep meeting objectives.
