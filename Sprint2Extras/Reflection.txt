The team performed adequately this sprint. We were quite a ways off the full functionality goal by the mid-sprint check-in, due to a bit of roughness getting things started and a few blocking issues. However, by the end of the sprint I believe we have completed all or nearly all of the required functionality.

Next sprint we will be sure to hold to the 2/3 mark deadline for functionality. Likewise, we will integrate the full suite of extra processes (code quality analysis, code reviews, and a burndown chart with time estimate).
