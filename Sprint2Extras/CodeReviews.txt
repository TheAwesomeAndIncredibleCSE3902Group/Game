PlayerStateMachine Readability:
	PlayerStateMachine has only one comment explaining something in the code, but I think most of the code is very readable just through the names of the variables and methods.
AnimatableSprite Maintainability:
	AnimatableSprite seems to have high cohesion and not really any more than the required amount of coupling.

CharacterSpriteFactory Readability (By Eli): 
	All methods and variables are named well and I consider the code to be "self commented."
CommandResetGame Maintainability (by John):
	Although this class will change a lot after implementing level states and xml layout files, in its current state any changes to the inital game state would need to be added individually.

-------------------------------------
Review took 15 minutes

Readability:
Very readable. All methods have signature comments. Variable and parameter names are descriptive.
Methods are short and seem to handle one unit of behavior. Method names descriptive. 
"InitializeSwapCommands" is slightly vague. The difference between keyPress and keyDown could be made more descriptive with a comment.

Code quality:
Generally good quality, though some areas are better than others.
Known limitations: switching to standing is not handled well. This was a point of difficulty for the team because triggering on the *absense* of input is surprisingly hard. This behavior should be transferred to Player instead.
Otherwise, linking input to Commands is simple and easily editable.
A hypothetical change that might be necessary is the addition of more key -> command linkings, or just the change of button for a particular control. Both of these would be easy to implement, as that's basically the only behavior that KeyboardController is in charge of.



Eli reviewing Item/Projectiles/PlayerBoomerang.cs

Review took ~30 minutes
-------------------------------------

Readability:
I believe that everything within this class, which extends the Projectile abstract class,
is readable. Each variable within PlayerBoomerang (and Projectile) are self-descriptive in
their naming. Within the projectile class, there are comments describing the units
of the movementSpeed and lifetime, which are used within the PlayerBoomerang class. 
It may be a good idea to rename these variables to include the units directly in the
names, but otherwise the naming is good. There is also a comment which describes how 
an issue in SpriteFactory which causes the Boomerang sprite to not work correctly, which will
be useful in narrowing down the problem when we fix this bug in the future.

Code quality:
I believe that the code quality is fairly good. Using a separate abstract class to handle
the code that would otherwise be reused across multiple classes is a good design decision.
The summary at the top makes it clear that PlayerBoomerang is managed by the singleton
Player class and the Destroy method directly references the Player's single instance.
However this may cause issues if, for example, we added new player types or
multiplayer support is ever added in the future. One way that we may be able to de-couple 
from the player class is having a separate singleton that keeps track of every projectile
created by any member of the IPlayer interface rather than having it be the job of the
Player class itself.
