PlayerStateMachine Readability:
	PlayerStateMachine has only one comment explaining something in the code, but I think most of the code is very readable just through the names of the variables and methods.
AnimatableSprite Maintainability:
	AnimatableSprite seems to have high cohesion and not really any more than the required amount of coupling.
