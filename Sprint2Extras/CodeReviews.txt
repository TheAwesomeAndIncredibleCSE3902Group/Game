PlayerStateMachine Readability:
	PlayerStateMachine has only one comment explaining something in the code, but I think most of the code is very readable just through the names of the variables and methods.
AnimatableSprite Maintainability:
	AnimatableSprite seems to have high cohesion and not really any more than the required amount of coupling.

CharacterSpriteFactory Readability: 
	All methods and variables are named well and I consider the code to be "self commented."
CommandResetGame Maintainability:
	Although this class will change a lot after implementing level states and xml layout files, in its current state any changes to the inital game state would need to be added individually.
