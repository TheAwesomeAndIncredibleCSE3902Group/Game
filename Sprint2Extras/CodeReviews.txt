PlayerStateMachine Readability:
	PlayerStateMachine has only one comment explaining something in the code, but I think most of the code is very readable just through the names of the variables and methods.
AnimatableSprite Maintainability:
	AnimatableSprite seems to have high cohesion and not really any more than the required amount of coupling.

CharacterSpriteFactory Readability (By Eli): 
	All methods and variables are named well and I consider the code to be "self commented."
CommandResetGame Maintainability (by John):
	Although this class will change a lot after implementing level states and xml layout files, in its current state any changes to the inital game state would need to be added individually. 


Lupine reviewing KeyboardController

Sprint2
-------------------------------------
Review took 15 minutes

Readability:
Very readable. All methods have signature comments. Variable and parameter names are descriptive.
Methods are short and seem to handle one unit of behavior. Method names descriptive. 
"InitializeSwapCommands" is slightly vague. The difference between keyPress and keyDown could be made more descriptive with a comment.

Code quality:
Generally good quality, though some areas are better than others.
Known limitations: switching to standing is not handled well. This was a point of difficulty for the team because triggering on the *absense* of input is surprisingly hard. This behavior should be transferred to Player instead.
Otherwise, linking input to Commands is simple and easily editable.
A hypothetical change that might be necessary is the addition of more key -> command linkings, or just the change of button for a particular control. Both of these would be easy to implement, as that's basically the only behavior that KeyboardController is in charge of.
